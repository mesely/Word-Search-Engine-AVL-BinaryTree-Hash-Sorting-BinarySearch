# Word-Search-Engine-AVL-BinaryTree-Hash-Sorting-BinarySearch

# 1. AVL Tree Version

This C++ program simulates a search engine for text files using an AVL tree for efficient word frequency analysis.

## Features

- Add and search words across multiple text files.
- Case-insensitive word handling.
- Remove words from memory.
- List occurrences of specific words in files.

## File Structure

- **`main.cpp`**: Main application logic.
- **`tree.h`**: AVL tree implementation.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of text files and their names.
3. Query words or request word removals.
4. Type "ENDOFINPUT" to exit.

## Example

```cpp
Enter the number of input files: 2
Enter the name of file 1: file1.txt
Enter the name of file 2: file2.txt
Enter queried words in one line: example
Enter queried words in one line: REMOVE example
